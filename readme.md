## About

**RansomGuard** is a web platform that uses **Machine Learning** to detect ransomware in executable files. The system performs a static analysis of an uploaded `.exe` or `.dll` file (without executing it) and returns a real-time prediction:

- **SAFE** — the file is likely benign
- **RANSOMWARE** — the file exhibits malicious characteristics

This project was developed as part of a research paper on **"Ransomware Evolution and Defense Mechanisms"**.
